# Odin_Landing_Page

Hola! This is my second Odin project of the Foundations course.

It will consist of applying all of the HTML & CSS I've learned so far. From div containers to ul's and images.

From the box-model to flexbox.

In this project, I have leveraged these tools to make a beautiful landing page with a satirical topic:

"AI Job Replacement Insurance"

A mock landing page with insurance plans for when Skynet finally takes all our jobs.
